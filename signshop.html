    <div class="container">
        <div class="content">Hello! This is a screenshot
            tutorial of how to create the four basic and most common types of Signshop signs, <span
                    style="color: #0040FF">[Buy]</span>, <span style="color: #0040FF">[Sell]</span>, <span
                    style="color: #0040FF">[Donate]</span> and <span style="color: #0040FF">[DonateHand]</span>.
            Actually <span style="color: #0040FF">[Donate]</span> signs are very rare but they're a hybrid of the <span
                    style="color: #0040FF">[Buy]</span>/<span style="color: #0040FF">[Sell]</span> ones and the <span
                    style="color: #0040FF">[DonateHand]</span> ones, and I had an extra sign on hand, so I put that in
            too. Sorry.<br><br><br><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;"><span style="font-weight: bold">SOME COMMON BUGS</span></span><br>-
            If you are setting up a <span style="color: #0040FF">[Buy]</span> or <span
                    style="color: #0040FF">[Sell]</span> sign, DO NOT INCLUDE MORE THAN ONE PERIOD IN THE LAST LINE
            (price). The item will be flagged as being on sale for 0.00 coins!<br>- You cannot use signs while holding
            dye items (bonemeal, cacti, lapis lazuli, etc) because they're linked to some sign replace function in the
            Signshop code. Therefore you cannot donate them, nor redstone dust, using <span style="color: #0040FF">[DonateHand]</span>
            signs, even though that Signshop functionality is disabled for us mortals. Regular <span
                    style="color: #0040FF">[Buy]</span>, <span style="color: #0040FF">[Sell]</span> and <span
                    style="color: #0040FF">[Donate]</span> signs work though as we do not have to be holding those items
            to use those signs.<br>- As of last patch, the first line of the sign (<span
                    style="color: #0040FF">[Buy]</span>, <span style="color: #0040FF">[Sell]</span>, etc) gets indented
            weirdly once the link between the sign and chest has been set up. Looks very strange.<br>- As of last patch,
            you sometimes cannot break a sign (<span style="color: #0040FF">[Buy]</span>, <span style="color: #0040FF">[Sell]</span>,
            etc) once the link has been set up and the first line has turned <span style="color: #0040FF">blue</span>.
            To get around this, break the block the sign is attached to and it should pop free.<br><br><br><span
                    style="font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;"><span style="color: #ed0000">This guide hasn't been updated for the latest plugin version. The only difference is that you must punch the chest before the sign.</span></span><br><br><br><span
                    style="font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;"><span style="font-weight: bold">Selling items (<span
                    style="color: #0040FF">[Buy]</span> signs)</span></span><br><br><span
                    style="color: #0040FF">[Buy]</span> Signs allow the player to buy things from you - if you are the
            owner of a shop and want to sell things to customers, this is the sign you want to use.<br><br>To create a
            <span style="color: #0040FF">[Buy]</span> sign, place a sign with the following syntax:<br>- The first line
            has to just contain the text: [Buy]<br>- The second and third line can contain any text. These are commonly
            used to describe the item/s on sale.<br>- The fourth line can contain any text, but must contain a number in
            the form X, or X.YZ on the line somewhere. It doesn't matter if you put $X.YZ, X pennies, X cheetoes, or
            whatever currency you want to call it. The number just has to be there.<br>For example,<br><img class="img-responsive" class="img-responsive"
                    src="images/guides/signshop/buy1.png" alt="Image"><br><br>You must also ensure you select a target chest,
            and fill it with EXACTLY the type and number of items you want to sell per transaction. Be careful, if you
            wanted to sell 1 diamond, and you put a stack of 5 in and set up the connection between the sign and the
            chest, it will sell all 5 diamonds to the first person that clicks on the sign wanting to buy one! Instead
            you must put 1 diamond in, set up the connection, and then put the other 4 in to make sure your shop has
            enough stock.<br><br>So in this case, I will set up a sign to sell 1 slime ball for 5 coins. First I ensure
            that there is exactly 1 slime ball in the chest I want to use to store my stock.<br><img class="img-responsive"
                    src="images/guides/signshop/buy2.png" alt="Image"><br><br>Then I set up the sign, and left or right click
            on the sign while holding redstone dust.<br><img class="img-responsive" src="images/guides/signshop/buy3.png" alt="Image"><br><br>Lastly,
            I left click on the chest containing the single slime ball while holding redstone dust.<br><img class="img-responsive"
                    src="images/guides/signshop/buy4.png" alt="Image"><br><br>Note the status messages after each step. If I am
            putting multiple items up for sale from one sign (ie an "iron golem DIY kit" containing 4 iron blocks and 1
            pumpkin), the last status message will summarise all the items that will be sold per transaction. Always
            check the last line to ensure that there are no mistakes! It is possible to accidentally set the shop up to
            sell multiple items for the price of 1, or sell the items in the shop for 0.00 coins. <br><br><span
                    style="font-weight: bold"><span
                    style="text-decoration: underline">Remember to lock your chests!</span></span><br><br><br><span
                    style="font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;"><span style="font-weight: bold">Buying items (<span
                    style="color: #0040FF">[Sell]</span> signs)</span></span><br><br>Similarly, <span
                    style="color: #0040FF">[Sell]</span> signs allow the player to sell things to you - if you are the
            owner of a shop and want to allow players to sell you items for a fee, this is the sign you want to use.<br><br>The
            syntax for a <span style="color: #0040FF">[Sell]</span> sign is the same as a <span style="color: #FF0000">[Buy]</span>
            one:<br>- The first line has to just contain the text: [Sell]<br>- The second and third line can contain any
            text. These are commonly used to describe the item you want to buy.<br>- The fourth line can contain any
            text, but must contain a number in the form X, or X.YZ on the line somewhere.<br>For example,<br><img class="img-responsive"
                    src="images/guides/signshop/sell1.png" alt="Image"><br><br>You then select a target chest and fill it with
            EXACTLY the number of items you want to buy per transaction. So if you want to set up a sign to buy 64 glass
            blocks at a time, you must first have 64 glass blocks, put that in the chest, and link the sign to it. You
            do not need to keep the source item in the chest, so after that you may remove the items in the chest, if
            you like.<br><br>So in this case, I will set up a sign to buy 1 slime ball for 0.75 coins. First I ensure
            that there is exactly 1 slime ball in the chest.<br><img class="img-responsive" src="images/guides/signshop/sell2.png"
                                                                     alt="Image"><br><br>Then I set up the sign, and
            left or right click on the sign while holding redstone dust.<br><img class="img-responsive" src="images/guides/signshop/sell3.png"
                                                                                 alt="Image"><br><br>Lastly, I left
            click on the chest containing the single slime ball while holding redstone dust.<br><img class="img-responsive"
                    src="images/guides/signshop/sell4.png" alt="Image"><br><br>Note the status messages after each step. Be
            sure to check the item and price at the end. Also as a reminder again, you may remove the items in the chest
            after doing this, if you like.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold"><span
                    style="text-decoration: underline">Remember to lock your chests!</span></span><br><br><br><span
                    style="font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;"><span style="font-weight: bold">Donate items (<span
                    style="color: #0040FF">[Donate]</span> signs)</span></span><br><br><span style="color: #0040FF">[Donate]</span>
            signs are set up exactly the same way as <span style="color: #FF0000">[Buy]</span>/<span
                    style="color: #FF0000">[Sell]</span> signs. These are seldom used because they are tied specifically
            to only one item. Some possible uses for these are for the customer to donate back wooden bowls after buying
            and consuming your wooden bowls, sorting large amounts of resource stacks, donating dye items (which do not
            work with <span style="color: #FF0000">[DonateHand]</span> signs), or if t2t2 keeps griefing your <span
                    style="color: #FF0000">[DonateHand]</span> chest with seeds. Then again, it might not help that last
            case.<br><br>The syntax for a <span style="color: #0040FF">[Donate]</span> sign is simpler:<br>- The first
            line has to just contain the text: [Donate]<br>- The other lines can contain any text. These are commonly
            used to describe what item the sign will take, and why.<br>For example,<br><img class="img-responsive"
                    src="images/guides/signshop/donate1.png" alt="Image"><br><br>You then select a target chest and fill it
            with EXACTLY the number of items you want to get per donation. As before, you will need to actually own the
            correct number of the item you want to be donated to you, to set up the chest. You do not need to keep the
            source item in the chest after either, so you may remove the items in the chest after setting up the sign,
            if you like.<br><br>So in this case, I will set up a sign to allow the user to donate 1 slime ball to me.
            First I ensure that there is exactly 1 slime ball in the chest.<br><img class="img-responsive" src="images/guides/signshop/donate2.png"
                                                                                    alt="Image"><br><br>Then I set up
            the sign, and left or right click on the sign while holding redstone dust.<br><img class="img-responsive"
                    src="images/guides/signshop/donate3.png" alt="Image"><br><br>Lastly, I left click on the chest containing
            the single slime ball while holding redstone dust.<br><img class="img-responsive" src="images/guides/signshop/donate4.png"
                                                                       alt="Image"><br><br>Note the status messages
            after each step. Be sure to check the item and quantity at the end. Also as a reminder again, you may remove
            the items in the chest after doing this, if you like.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold"><span
                    style="text-decoration: underline">Remember to lock your chests!</span></span><br><br><br><span
                    style="font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;"><span style="font-weight: bold">Generic Donation signs (<span
                    style="color: #0040FF">[DonateHand]</span> signs)</span></span><br><br><span style="color: #0040FF">[DonateHand]</span>
            signs allow the user to donate whatever item they are currently "holding" to the target chest. The user must
            put the item in their shortcut bar, select it, and then right click on your sign. They are easier to set up
            than the other signs, and are great because they are not tied to just any one item. They are often used as
            generic donation chests in shops, or in a mining outpost to donate resources back to your home base. Another
            use for them is to link one from your house to the donation chests in Leoville spawn, so that you can
            quickly restock those chests with extra stuff.<br><br>The syntax for a <span style="color: #0040FF">[DonateHand]</span>
            sign is the same as a <span style="color: #FF0000">[Donate]</span> one:<br>- The first line has to just
            contain the text: [DonateHand]<br>- The other lines can contain any text. These are commonly used to
            describe where the donation will go to.<br>For example,<br><img class="img-responsive" src="images/guides/signshop/dh1.png"
                                                                            alt="Image"><br><br>You then hit the sign
            with redstone, select a target chest and hit that too, and that's it! You must be able to normally use the
            chest, if the chest is locked and you are not on the access list then you will not be able to make that
            chest the target of your <span style="color: #0040FF">[DonateHand]</span> sign either.<br><br>So in this
            case, I will set up a sign to allow the user to donate an item back to a chest at my house. First I set up
            the sign, and left or right click on the sign while holding redstone dust.<br><img class="img-responsive"
                    src="images/guides/signshop/dh2.png" alt="Image"><br><br>Then I go to where my target chest is, and left
            click on the chest while holding redstone dust.<br><img class="img-responsive" class="img-responsive" src="images/guides/signshop/dh3.png" alt="Image"><br><br>And
            that's it! Now I can donate all manner of items from where my sign is, to where my chest is, as long as the
            chest has room in it. You cannot donate dye items to <span style="color: #0040FF">[DonateHand]</span>
            chests, though, nor redstone dust, as they are linked to other Signshop functions.<br><br><span
                    style="font-weight: bold"><span

                    style="font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;"><span style="font-weight: bold">Frequently Asked Questions</span></span><br><br>Q:
            Hi! I'm a shopper, but I'm not sure what this sign is buying or selling?<br>A: LEFT click on the sign to
            check what the shop is buying or selling before right clicking on it to complete the transaction! When you
            left click on the sign, the game tells you the exact transaction that the sign involves.<br><br>Q: What does
            a <span style="color: #FF0000">red</span> sign mean?<br>A: It usually means either the linked chest is empty
            (for <span style="color: #0040FF">[Buy]</span> signs), or full (for <span
                    style="color: #0040FF">[Sell]</span>, <span style="color: #0040FF">[Donate]</span>, or <span
                    style="color: #0040FF">[DonateHand]</span> signs).<br><br>Q: But I just restocked all the items in
            the chest! And added a new item! And all the <span style="color: #0040FF">[Buy]</span> signs (but one) still
            show <span style="color: #FF0000">red</span>!<br>A: To force the signs to update in these cases, left click
            on any of the signs. All the linked signs should update and turn <span style="color: #0040FF">blue</span> as
            appropriate.<br><br>Q: Can I link more than one sign to a chest?<br>A: Yes. You can link multiple <span
                    style="color: #0040FF">[Buy]</span>, <span style="color: #0040FF">[Sell]</span>, <span
                    style="color: #0040FF">[Donate]</span>, <span style="color: #0040FF">[DonateHand]</span>, or
            combinations thereof to a single chest. You can sell several different items linked to different signs but
            keep all the stock in a single chest, you just have to remove all the items each time you want to add a new
            item for sale from that chest. A bit more of a hassle, but less chests cluttering up the place.<br><br>Q:
            Can I link more than one chest to a sign? (Say if the first one becomes full)<br>A: Sadly not!<br><br>Q: Do
            connections between the signs and their linked chests work across different (Multiverse) worlds?<br>A: They
            sure do!<br><br>Q: Is there a way to make a <span style="color: #0040FF">[Sell]</span> or <span
                    style="color: #0040FF">[Donate]</span> sign for an item I don't have?<br>A: Nope, not without at
            least borrowing the item from someone else.<br><br>Q: It says, "The sign you clicked doesn't have a valid
            operation!" when I try to set up a sign.<br>A: You have to capitalise the B in <span style="color: #0040FF">[Buy]</span>,
            S in <span style="color: #0040FF">[Sell]</span>, D in <span style="color: #0040FF">[Donate]</span>, and both
            the D and H in <span style="color: #0040FF">[DonateHand]</span>. Everything else must be in
            lowercase.<br><br>Q: It says, "Please hit the sign with the new info first." when I try to use a sign.<br>A:
            You're trying to use a sign while holding a dye item. Hold something else (or nothing) and try again. If you
            are trying to use a <span style="color: #0040FF">[DonateHand]</span> sign with that item, well, you can't.
            See Bugs section at the top.<br><br>Q: It says, "Can you build? Yes." or "WorldGuard: No defined regions
            here!" (or other weird messages)<br>A: You're trying to use a sign while holding an item that has another
            defined action for right-clicking from another mod. In the case of the two examples given here, that's when
            you are holding string and WorldGuard is installed/configured.<br><br>Q: Can you 'limit' the amount of an
            item you want to buy? So someone doesn't clean me out of all my money selling me stacks of glass when I only
            really want to buy 1 or 2 at a time and pay a fair price for it?<br>A: Kind of, to an extent. Say if you
            only wanted to buy a maximum of 5 stacks of an item, you could fill the linked chest with junk so that there
            are only 5 spots open in the chest, with the rest of the spots containing 1 seed in each, or something like
            that. Similarly with half-stacks, though they're tougher to do as you need more of a source item. If you
            wanted to buy a half a stack of books, you could fill the rest of the chest with spare junk, and have a
            half-stack of books already in there so any sellers would only be able to fill up the rest of it before the
            chest runs out of stock. <br>
